![My Skills](/images/skills.png)

I am a third year Computer Science student at Florida State University with a strong passion for Software Engineering, particularly in backend development and mobile applications. I have experience working with **C++, C#, Java, Python, Linux, SQL, Android Studio, and [more](https://acortez1003.github.io/cv/).** 

Currently, I work as a **Learning Assistant** for the Pre-Calculus course at FSU, where I continuously strengthen my communication and problem-solving skills. Outside of academics, I am an active member of the **FSU Marching Chiefs**, where I've learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and leadership.

Some of my favorite projects include a mockup of a [Real Estate Listing Service](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/), a full-stack web application with database management and [Ascend: Path of No Return](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/ascend/), a metroidvania style video game made in Godot. I have also started a personal project - a mobile application called [Gift Loop](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5) which is designed to solve issues when it comes to giving gifts in a group setting. Feel free to track my progress on this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/acortez1003/GiftLoop).

I am actively seeking internship opportunities in software engineering, where I can apply my skills and continue growing as a developer.
