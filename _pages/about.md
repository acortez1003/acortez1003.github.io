![My Skills](/images/skills.png)

I am a third year Computer Science student at Florida State University with a strong passion for Software Engineering, particularly in backend development and mobile applications. I have experience working with **C++, C#, Java, Python, Linux, SQL, Android Studio, and [more](https://acortez1003.github.io/cv/).** 

Currently, I work as a **Learning Assistant** for the Pre-Calculus course at FSU, where I continuously strengthen my communication and problem-solving skills. Outside of academics, I am an active member of the **FSU Marching Chiefs**, where I've learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and leadership.

Some of my favorite projects include a [Sudoku Solver](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), a website that helps users solve Sudoku puzzles and [Ascend: Path of No Return](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/), a metroidvania style video game made in Godot. The most recent project I've worked on was a real-time [system monitoring dashboard](https://acortez1003.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) using Flask, Netdata, and SQLite across a 5-user cluster.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities in software engineering, where I can apply my skills and continue growing as a developer.
